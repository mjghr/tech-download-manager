# Go Download Mangaer - [Repositiry Link](https://github.com/mjghr/tech-download-manager)
A file downloader that leverages Go concurrency to download public files off the Internet

## Features:
+ **Concurrent** Downloads: Split files into chunks and download them concurrently for faster downloads.
+ **Pause/Resume**: Pause and resume downloads at any time.
+ **Speed Limit**: Set download speed limits to control bandwidth usage.
+ **Queue Management**: Manage multiple downloads in a queue with configurable concurrency limits.
+ **Progress Tracking**: Track download progress in real-time.
+ **Time Window**: Schedule downloads to run within a specific time window.
+ **Temporary Files**: Use temporary files for resumable downloads and cleanup after completion.
+ **Error Handling**: Retry failed chunks and handle errors gracefully.

## Implementation:
We might be tempted to GET the entire file at once, but if it is a large file, it can cause certain limitations, which are mitigated if we Divide and Conquer i.e, we break down the large file into certain C chunks and GET each of the C chunks individually. Also, it has other merits.
